# FizzBuzz

Write a function that returns an array of integers from 1 up to and including a maximum number. But:

-  For multiples of 3, add "Fizz" to the array instead of the number.
-  For multiples of 5, add "Buzz" to the array instead of the number.
-  For multiples of 3 and 5, add "FizzBuzz" to the array instead of the number.

```js
function getFizzBuzz(max) {
   // YOUR CODE HERE
}

console.log(getFizzBuzz(100)); // generates a list of numbers 1 to 100, replacing some numbers as indicated.
```
